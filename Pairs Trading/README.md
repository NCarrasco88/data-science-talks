# Pairs Trading

## Background

This is a set of slides and resources for a short talk about pairs trading
(statistical arbitrage) I gave to the Data Science meetup group at PepsiCo.

I wrote these slides partially during professional development time, and
partially during evenings and weekends.


## Structure

The slides are probably the best place to start as the notebooks are
supporting material. The main notebook is "Identifying and Trading a Pair",
which contains links to plenty of other resources.
